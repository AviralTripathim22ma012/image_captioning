# 📸 Image Captioning Project 🖋️

## Welcome to the Image Captioning Project! 🚀

### Overview ℹ️
This project focuses on generating captions for images using deep learning techniques. Image captioning is the task of generating a descriptive sentence that accurately describes the content of an image. 

### Key Features 🔑
- Implementation of a neural network model for image captioning.
- Training the model on image-caption pairs to learn associations between images and captions.
- Generating captions for unseen images using the trained model.
- Evaluation of the generated captions using standard metrics such as BLEU score.

### Getting Started 🎬
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of image captioning.
4. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the model and generate captions for sample images.

### Usage 💡
- Train the image captioning model on your own dataset of image-caption pairs.
- Generate captions for new images using the trained model.
- Evaluate the quality of the generated captions using standard metrics.
